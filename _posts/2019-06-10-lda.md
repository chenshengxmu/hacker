* α is the parameter of the Dirichlet prior on the per-document topic distributions,
* β is the parameter of the Dirichlet prior on the per-topic word distribution,
* $$ \theta _{i} $$ is the topic distribution for document i,
* $$ \varphi _{k} $$ is the word distribution for topic k,
* $$ z_{ij} $$ is the topic for the j-th word in document i, and
* $$ w_{ij} $$ is the specific word.

The fact that W is grayed out means that words $$ w_{ij} $$ are the only observable variables, and the other variables are latent variables. 


It is helpful to think of the entities represented by $$ \theta $$ and $$ \varphi $$ as matrices created by decomposing the original document-word matrix that represents the corpus of documents being modeled. 

In this view, $$ \theta $$ consists of rows defined by documents and columns defined by topics, while $$ \varphi $$ consists of rows defined by topics and columns defined by words. 

Thus, $$ {\varphi _{1} ,\dots ,\varphi _{K}} $$ refers to a set of rows, or vectors, each of which is a distribution over words, and $$ {\theta _{1},\dots ,\theta _{M}} $$ refers to a set of rows, each of which is a distribution over topics.
